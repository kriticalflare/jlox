# jlox

jlox is a work-in-progress interpreter for the Lox programming language, built following the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom.

## Introduction

This project aims to implement a fully functional interpreter for the Lox programming language, as described in the book "Crafting Interpreters". Lox is a dynamically typed, object-oriented language with a C-like syntax.

## Features

- Lexical analysis (tokenization) of Lox source code
- Parsing of Lox expressions and statements
- Evaluation of Lox expressions and statements
- Support for basic control flow structures (if statements, while loops, etc.)
- Object-oriented programming features (classes, inheritance, etc.)

## Acknowledgements

- The book "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom for providing the inspiration and guidance for this project.
- The Lox programming language was created by Bob Nystrom.
